1. Set up repo to auto-add build artifacts if there has been changes to src, etc. dirs (or just run `npm run build`) and check those in...
or make this a post-commit hook? so we never commit w/o build artifacts and/or have race condition when pushing to mainline (unless we protect mainline w/ PRs only and have the build artifacts uploaded to the PR)

2. Sync node18 in action.yml to .nvmrc (so we don't forget how to specify the node engine for J/TS spec. actions)

# Minimize deps.

Are these needed? Could be reworked to use std. libraries?

* @putout/git-status-porcelain, "^1.1.0"
  only used in 1 place: ...
* node-readfiles, "0.2.0"
  only used in 1 place: for determining deleteOrphan functionality
* action-input-parser, ^1.2.33
  only used in 1 place:
  another BetaHuhn creation; look to remove for decoupling
* js-yaml, "^4.1.0"
